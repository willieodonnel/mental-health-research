The patient's curiosity about a deeper layer to reality and undiscovered methods for encoding information within the universe is not necessarily a sign of mental health issues. However, it is important to consider the context and historical background of these beliefs.\n\nIf the patient's belief system is causing significant distress, interfering with daily functioning, or leading to maladaptive behaviors, then a more in-depth assessment may be necessary. For example, if the patient's beliefs are leading them to neglect self-care, social connections, or work/school responsibilities, then this would be a concern.\n\nAdditionally, if the patient's beliefs are associated with other symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, or paranoia, then this would be a more significant concern.\n\nWithout further information, it is difficult to make a definitive assessment.
