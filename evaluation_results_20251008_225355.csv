These pressures, coupled with a perceived lack of understanding and respect for the patient's boundaries from their friends and church members, seem to be contributing to elevated anxiety levels. This heightened anxiety is making it difficult for the patient to focus on self-care, which they perceive as a daunting task.

It's important to note that the patient's feelings of overwhelm and their perceived inability to fulfill self-care needs may be indicative of caregiver burnout, a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion often accompanied by a change in attitude, from positive and caring to negative and unconcerned. 

Given the patient's current state, it may be beneficial to explore stress management strategies tailored to their specific needs and circumstances. This could include cognitive-behavioral techniques to manage anxiety, assertiveness training to aid in boundary setting, and respite care options to allow for self-care. It may also be beneficial to connect the patient with a support group for caregivers, where they can share their experiences and learn from others in similar situations.

Ultimately, it's important that the patient feels heard, validated, and supported in their feelings. It could be valuable to reassure them that their needs and feelings are valid and that seeking support is not a burden but a part of healthy interpersonal relationships. Additionally, we should continue to monitor their emotional wellbeing and provide resources to help them manage their stress and feelings of guilt, such as mindfulness exercises or self-care strategies.","I see that you're feeling a lot of stress because you're not getting the support you need from your family, especially your mom. And it's even tougher because you're not sure if you're asking too much of them, and you're feeling guilty about it. You know, this is something a lot of people go through, especially when they're taking care of others or dealing with a lot of stress. It's really important to remember that it's totally okay to ask for help and express what you need.

I think it might be helpful for us to talk more about these feelings of guilt and worry that you're burdening others. There are some techniques we can use, like cognitive behavioral therapy, that can help you challenge these feelings and find healthier ways to express your needs. We could also look into family therapy or find a way to help you talk with your family about this, to help everyone understand each other better.

I want you to know that your feelings are valid and it's okay to ask for help. You're not a burden - needing support is just a part of being in relationships with other people. We're going to keep an eye on how you're doing emotionally, and we'll also find some resources to help you manage your stress and feelings of guilt. Things like mindfulness exercises and self-care strategies can be really helpful.

I'm here for you, and we're going to work through this together.",5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4.86
